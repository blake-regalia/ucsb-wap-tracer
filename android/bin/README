This APK may or may not crash unexpectedly. If you experience frequent crashes, please inform me at: blake.regalia@gmail.com 

Copy "ucsb_wap_tracer.apk" to your device, install it, then run "UCSB WAP Tracer" from your applications menu.

Wait for the application to get a fix on your location, then press the "Start" button.
The device will log your position along with the access point data.
When you are done with your trip from A to B, press the "Stop" button.

The application will then attempt to upload the trace file to our server. If for whatever reason the upload fails...
The logs will be saved at: /sdcard/ucsb-wap-traces/*.bin
You may copy these .bin files over to your computer, package them into a .zip file, and then send them as an email attachment to blake
